KNN 
Higher average accaurcy as compared to scikitlearns knn predictions though a slower by many margins keep that in mind while using this package

edit the following line with your data path
path = ('C:/Users/gshea/Desktop/School/Summer2021/Artifical/DataSets/fruits_classification.xlsx')

edit this line to set your data range and what your classifer is
averageList = ScreamingProcesser(iterations=value, classifer=1, startData=3, endData=6, kNear=10)

iterations: how many times knn will run
classifer: is what you are trying to predict
startData, EndData: intial starting point of data and end point
KNear: how many k nearest neighbors it will grab it will iterate starting from that to 1
path: set path to this currently supports xslm and csv
